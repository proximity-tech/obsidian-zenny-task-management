## Zenny Task Manager for Obsidian

A calm, powerful task system to help you get things done without the overwhelm. Built for modern life, fully inside your Obsidian vault.

Zenny ✅ — task management for people who want clarity, focus, and momentum.

---

### Why Zenny?

50,000 years ago, humans had three problems: find food, find shelter, and procreate. Today we juggle hundreds: stay healthy, learn skills, nurture relationships, pay bills, ship projects, plan travel, read more, meditate, walk 10k steps, track appointments, renew licenses, invest on time — the list never ends. One lifetime doesn’t feel like enough... unless your system helps you focus on what matters.

Zenny turns the chaos into clarity. Track personal, professional, and project tasks; set long/short‑term goals; run focus sessions; and generate daily/weekly/monthly summaries — all within Markdown, all in your vault.

### Quick start

1. Install the plugin (see Installation below) and enable it.
2. Open the command palette and launch Zenny.
3. Set your `Default Tasks Folder` and `Default Inbox File` in Settings.
4. Capture a task using natural language (e.g., “Email Alex about Q4 deck tomorrow 9am).
5. Prioritize using urgency/impact, then start a focus session to move the needle.

Tip: Keep a daily note open for context; Zenny will keep your actual tasks tidy in your chosen folder.

---

### Settings

- **Default Tasks Folder**: Where Zenny stores projects/tasks (relative to vault root). Defaults to `tasks`.

### Philosophy

Modern life is wonderfully complex — but that doesn’t mean your day should be chaotic. Zenny helps you:

- **Reduce overwhelm** by showing only what matters today
- **Make progress** on high‑impact items, not just “busy” work
- **Stay consistent** with light structure and helpful defaults

We’re also exploring a gentle “coach mode” for people who don’t enjoy planning. It will surface a few smart, high‑leverage tasks each day so you can build momentum without decision fatigue.

---

### Roadmap (selected)

- Smart daily suggestions for non-planners (fewer, high‑impact tasks)
- Richer Eisenhower and project dashboards
- More flexible reporting and exports
- Optional backend sync for team workflows
